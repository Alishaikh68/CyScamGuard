## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CyberSentinel.git
cd CyberSentinel
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have `requirements.txt`, manually run:

```bash
pip install flask google-generativeai PyPDF2
```

### 4. Get Google Gemini API Key

* Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
* Create an API key
* Add this in your `main.py`:

```python
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_actual_api_key_here"
```

---

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python main.py
```

Open your browser and go to:
**[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* The app sends your uploaded file text or URL to **Google Gemini AI**
* Custom prompts classify the content based on known phishing/malware indicators
* The AI returns a clear result: SCAM or LEGIT, BENIGN or MALWARE, etc.
